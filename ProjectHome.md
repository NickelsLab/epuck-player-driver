### Construction of a driver for use e-puck robots with Player. ###

This project is developed in [VeRLab](http://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br) (Laboratório de Visão Computacional e Robótica), from [DCC](http://www.dcc.ufmg.br) (Departamento de Ciência da Computação) of [UFMG](http://www.ufmg.br) (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais).

**Since Player 3.0 the e-puck driver is part of Player itself. The computer side of this driver is not necessary anymore, only the code that will be uploaded on e-puck.**

**News in version 0.4:**
  * Added support for Player 2.1 (work with Player 2.0 and 2.1);
  * Added support for LEDs;
  * Added compatibility with the new e-puck cameras (PO6030K);
  * The image grabbed from camera is delivered always in correct orientation.
